# GWC-Rocklin-High-Website
### Our Girls Who Code website is a team project started up by 6 members of GWC at Rocklin High School in December 2020.
### This repo includes the source code, images, CSS, and setup for our Girls Who Code website (https://rhsgirlswhocode.club/).
### I am the main contributor to the CSS portion of our website and I have experience working with Bootstrap. I also have experience with PHP and HTML on the website and I studied SQL and databases.
